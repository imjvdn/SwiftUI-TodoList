# SwiftUI Todo List

A lightweight task management app built with SwiftUI. This project demonstrates core iOS development concepts including state management, SwiftUI layouts, and CRUD operations.

## Features

- Add new tasks with validation
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete with visual indicators
- Delete tasks with swipe gestures
- Edit mode for batch task management
- Clean, intuitive UI with SF Symbols

## Implementation Details

This app showcases several key SwiftUI concepts:

- **State Management**: Using `@State` for local view state
- **Data Binding**: Connecting UI elements to state with the `$` prefix
- **SwiftUI Layout**: Implementing `NavigationView`, `List`, `HStack`, and other layout components
- **User Interaction**: Handling tap gestures and swipe actions
- **Conditional Rendering**: Changing UI elements based on task completion status
